**Task 1**
Write in English a technical document explaining how you would document the integration of a new payment gateway into the VTEX platform, considering all technical aspects involved, from
initial setup to transaction data validation and error handling.

---

# Get started with VTEX
(I would start with a "Get started" page with all the steps for the users to obtain an overview.)

## Steps to get integrated with our payment gateway
(Each bullet would direct the user to another page with detailed information about that step.)

- How to create a test account to get access to your customer area (if any).
- Testing integrations with VTEX, for example, doing payment tests in a validation environment.
- A list of important documents related to compliance, contracts, etc.
- How to start building the integration of the client with VTEX by choosing a certain model/business need (if there is such kind of division) for the selection of modules that will be used.
- Based on the chosen model, sign a contract.

## Configuration of the production account
(Each bullet would direct the user to another page with detailed information about that step.)

Here you can have setup configurations, such as:

- [Setup of payment methods](link to the corresponding page).
- Information on bank accounts for receiving payments (Finance settings).
- Reconciliation process.
- Risk and compliance information.

## Integration with VTEX APIs
(Each bullet would direct the user to another page with detailed information about that step.)

- Access credential generation and permissions.
- Webhooks configurations.
- Access to VTEX endpoints. Real test scenarios with successful and erroneous results (by entering incorrect card details, for example).
- A list of all the APIs needed for integration separated by groups, for example, all those related to payments, 3D secure, tokenization, etc.).

## Guidance for next steps
Information about managing your account after integration.
